        <h1 class="autoHead">Welcome To The CAD Module</h1>
        <h class="txt">I have completed the Computer Aided Design (CAD) module of  fab lab.  It was an interesting module with a creative task to create 2d and 3d designs. In this module I come to know about CAD softwares like fusion 360, Autocad , Solid Works etc. I  used fusion 360 and Autocad softwares for my designs and was comfortable with them. I learnt various commands and their uses to create a amazing designs.</h2>

        <h2 class="fusHead">Autocad</h2>
        
        <p class="txt">Autodesk AutoCAD is a popular computer-aided design (CAD) software used for creating precise 2D and 3D drawings. A "fab lab" is short for "fabrication laboratory," where people can create prototypes, designs, and even final products using various digital fabrication tools like 3D printers, laser cutters, CNC machines, and more.

            If you're looking for information on how to use AutoCAD within a fab lab context, you might be interested in learning how to design objects that can be fabricated using these tools, such as creating 3D models for printing or generating laser-cut designs. Feel free to provide more specific details about what you're looking for, and I'll be glad to assist you further!</p>

        <h2 class="fusHead">Fusion 360</h2>
        <p class="txt">Fusion 360 is a 3D CAD, CAM, and CAE software developed by Autodesk. It's commonly used for designing, engineering, and manufacturing products. "Fab Lab" typically refers to a fabrication laboratory, which is a place equipped with various digital fabrication tools such as 3D printers, laser cutters, CNC machines, etc., where individuals can create physical objects from digital designs.

            If you're looking for information about using Fusion 360 in a Fab Lab context, you might want to know how to design for specific fabrication processes, how to prepare your designs for 3D printing or other manufacturing techniques, and how to leverage the software's features to create precise and functional designs. Feel free to ask if you have specific questions about using Fusion 360 in a Fab Lab setting!</p>
